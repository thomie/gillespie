### Quickstart
$ cabal install mersenne-random-pure64
$ ghc -O2 --make simulation.hs
$ ./simulation



### Prerequisites
This package depends on the package mersenne-random-pure64.  

To install it, make sure you have the package cabal-install installed.

"The 'cabal' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs."

The recommended way of getting cabal-install is through the Haskell platform: http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/.

You can also install cabal-install manually: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install. If the bootstrap script complains about a missing time library, install it manually: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.2 (cabal-install version 0.8.2. says it depends on time version < 1.2).

When you have cabal-install installed and 'cabal' is in your path, do:

$ cabal update
$ cabal install mersenne-random-pure64

As a third option, you can try to install mersenne-random-pure64 manually: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mersenne-random-pure64.



### Compiling and running
$ ghc -O2 --make simulation.hs
$ ./simulation

or (but much slower)

$ runhaskell simulation.hs
